This compare the implementation made in basic_model_vs_ascasibar_model.nb, with the implementations made in
PhD/projects/star_feedback/code/models/reference_implementation, all in Mathematica. Then the implementation in .../reference_implementation
in C++ can be trusted to make the time measurements and comparisons, and to use them subsequently in a function implementation if needed.
