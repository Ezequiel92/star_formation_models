Explicit implementation of several star formation models.

The goal of the models is to improve the realism of the SFR (star formation rate) in simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.

- Models in `archived/models` are old models which served as experiments to understand the current one in use.

  - Each model has its folder `archived/models/model_XXX`, where the file `models/model_XXX/notebook_XXX.jl` is a [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) notebook showcasing the model.
  - The files inside the folders `archived/models/model_XXX/alternative_implementations` are scripts implementing the same model in different programming languages, namely [Julia](https://julialang.org), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [C](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/standards), [C++](https://isocpp.org/), and [Wolfram Language](https://www.wolfram.com/language/).
  - Each one of those scripts outputs a `.dat` file with the evolution of the variables after integrating the system for 1 Gyr. These files are saved in `archived/models/model_XXX/alternative_implementations/plots`, where the Mathematica notebook `plots.nb` will plot all the data together to compare the implementations. The goal is to test that all the implementations give the same results.
  - The dependencies are given by the `Project.toml`, and `requirements.txt` files.
  - The notebooks and scripts in `archived/analysis` were use to study and understand the old models.

- The current model in use is described by `model/model_019/description_m019.jl`.

## üìà Current model

Model 019 [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://binder.plutojl.org/v0.19.5/open?url=https%253A%252F%252Fgithub.com%252Fezequiel92%252Fstar_formation_models%252Fblob%252Fmain%252Fmodels%252Fmodel_019%252Fdescription_m019.jl%253Fraw%253Dtrue)

## üßÆ Solvers

The ODE solvers used in each implementation are:

- **Python**: [SciPy solve_ivp](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html)
- **C**: [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
- **C++**: [Boost odeint](https://headmyshoulder.github.io/odeint-v2/index.html)
- **Mathematica**: [NDSolve](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/NDSolve.html)
- **Julia**: [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/dev/)

## üìò Documentation

Although every implementation fully describes each system of ODEs, the main documentation for each model is the corresponding Pluto notebook. They show the system of equations, the values of the constants and plot the evolution of the main variables for a mock set of the initial conditions. You can use the Binder links in the [Models](https://github.com/ezequiel92/star_formation_models/blob/main/README.md#-models) section to explore and run every notebook.

The Wolfram Language notebooks inside each `models/model_XXX/alternative_implementations` plots the evolution of the variables too. They also generate the Jacobian functions needed for the C and C++ implementation, which are saved as `.../alternative_implementations/jacobian_gsl.txt` and `.../alternative_implementations/jacobian_boost.txt` respectively.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Run Locally

- **Pluto notebook**: The easiest way is to run the notebooks in Binder using the links from the [Models](https://github.com/ezequiel92/star_formation_models/blob/main/README.md#-models) section.

- **Julia and Python**: The Julia and Python scripts in `alternative_implementations` can be run directly with the corresponding interpreters. To install the dependecies:

  - Clone the project

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ezequiel92/star_formation_models.git
    ```

  - Go to the project directory

    ```bash
    cd path/to/star_formation_models
    ```

  - Install the dependencies specified by the `Manifest.toml` and `Project.toml` files (for Julia within the Julia REPL)

    ```julia
    (@v1.6) pkg> activate .

    (star_formation_models) pkg> instantiate
    ```

  - Or the ones specified by the `requirements.txt` file (for Python)

    ```python
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
  
  - Run (for Julia within the Julia REPL)

    ```julia
    julia> include("path/to/script.jl")
    ```

  - Or run (for Python)

    ```python
    python path/to/script.py
    ```

- **C**: To run the C scripts you have to link at compile time the [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) library. The VSCode recipe provided in the folder `.vscode` should compile and run the scripts for a [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/) installation of GSL in Windows. For other systems, changing the paths to the compiler and the library in `.vscode/tasks.jason` should be enough to make it work. For more info about VSCode tasks see [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks).
- **C++**: To run the C++ scripts you have to include at compile time the [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) library. The VSCode recipe provided in the folder `.vscode` should compile and run the scripts for a [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/) installation of Boost in Windows. For other systems, changing the paths to the compiler and the library in `.vscode/tasks.jason` should be enough to make it work. For more info about VSCode tasks see [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks).

These scripts are written for personal use and may break at any moment. So, use them at your own risk.
